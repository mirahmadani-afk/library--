        "**Regex:**\n",
        "\n",

        "^[a-zA-Z0-9][-a-zA-Z0-9]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]$\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Explanation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's break down the regex piece by piece:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **`^`**:  This is an anchor that asserts the start of the string. This ensures that the pattern must start at the beginning of the input string and not in the middle somewhere.\n",
        "2. **`[a-zA-Z0-9]`**: This character class matches any single character that is either an uppercase letter (A-Z), a lowercase letter (a-z) or a digit(0-9).  This meets your requirement that the string must start with an alphanumeric character.\n",
        "3.  **`[-a-zA-Z0-9]`**: This character class matches a single character which could be a hyphen or an alphanumeric character. This allows you to have alphanumeric as well as '-' characters.\n",
        "4. **`{0,61}`**: This is a quantifier which tells the regex engine to find the immediately preceding character class (`[-a-zA-Z0-9]`) 0 to 61 times. We are setting this as 61 since first charcter should be a alphanumeric only. This means rest of the characters would be in range of 0 to 61 resulting in a length from 2 to 63, meeting your length constraint.\n",
        "5. **`[a-zA-Z0-9]`**: Just like our beginning constraint this tells us to match for single alphanumeric character only at this point, this ensures the string ends with alphanumeric only.\n",
        "6.  **`$`**: This is another anchor. This asserts the end of the string, and matches end of string. It also ensures the pattern must match until the very end of input and doesn't terminate midway.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Detailed Explanation with Examples:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Valid Matches:**\n",
        "    *   `a1`: This would match as string start with an alphanumeric character (`a`) and ends with alphanumeric charcter `1` and also meets length criteria of 2 character long.\n",
        "    *   `abc-123`: Valid match since it starts with an alphanumeric character(`a`) ends with an alphanumeric character(`3`)  and it also have the - symbol. Also, Length requirement is between 2 and 63 characters, that too met with 7 characters here.\n",
        "    *    `XyZ12`: Matches starts with alphanumeric char, has an length within the bound and ends with a alphanumeric.\n",
        "    * `a-b-c-d-e-f-g-h-i-j-k-l-m-n-o-p-q-r-s-t-u-v-w-x-y-z-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12-13-14-15`: Length is 63 including hyphens. So it passes all checks and will be a valid match.\n",
        "    *   `12345`: Passes starting, ending alphanumeric conditions with total length of 5, so is a valid match.\n",
        "*   **Invalid Matches:**\n",
        "    *   `-abc` : This will not match as it is not starting with a alphanumeric character and starts with '-' character.\n",
        "    *   `abc-` : Doesn't end with a alphanumeric.\n",
        "    *   `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabc` : Contains 66 character which is more than required (63).\n",
        "     *  `a`: This is an invalid case as regex needs to have string with minimum 2 characters.\n",
